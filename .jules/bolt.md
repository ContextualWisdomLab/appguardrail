## 2024-05-24 - File traversal performance
**Learning:** When optimizing os.walk combined with Path objects, replacing them with os.scandir and os.path.splitext reduces stat() calls drastically, but requires careful matching of symlink behavior (os.walk matches directory symlinks depending on arguments, Path.is_file() follows symlinks by default).
**Action:** Use entry.is_dir(follow_symlinks=False) to match os.walk and entry.is_file() to match Path.is_file() default.

## 2024-06-11 - Global state caching in Python tests
**Learning:** When aggressively caching global module state (like pre-extracted regex rules from `SCAN_RULES`), tests using `unittest.mock.patch` on that global state may fail because the cache retains stale references to the unpatched objects.
**Action:** Implement cache-busting logic (e.g., tracking `id(SCAN_RULES)`) to clear the cache when the object identity changes.

## 2024-06-13 - Optimizing multiple pathlib stat checks
**Learning:** Checking `Path.is_symlink()`, `Path.is_file()`, and `Path.stat().st_size` individually on a pathlib object invokes multiple separate `stat()` system calls and generates overhead. For hot paths scanning thousands of files, this adds up significantly.
**Action:** Replace multiple `Path` metadata checks with a single `os.lstat(path)` call and `stat` module bitwise checks (e.g., `stat.S_ISLNK(st.st_mode)`, `stat.S_ISREG(st.st_mode)`) to collapse everything into one highly performant system call.

## 2026-06-14 - Deferring Pathlib Operations in Hot Paths
**Learning:** In highly repetitive loops like file scanners (e.g., iterating through thousands of safe files), preemptively calculating `Path.relative_to()` and sanitizing strings adds significant cumulative overhead. Pathlib operations internally parse paths, check parts, and construct new objects, which is extremely expensive when executed on a per-file basis unconditionally.
**Action:** Always defer expensive path computations (like converting paths to relative or string sanitization) until *after* the fast-path condition (like a regex match) triggers. This drastically cuts down on unnecessary string operations for clean files.

## 2024-06-18 - Optimize scanner loop using tuples
**Learning:** In highly repetitive parsing loops running on thousands of files (like a codebase scanner), unpacking values from a dictionary into the hot loop path repeatedly incurs a small overhead per element, per line scanned. Accessing dictionary keys introduces hash map lookup costs.
**Action:** When a static configuration object is frequently accessed in a tight loop, cache or map the list of dictionaries into a list of tuples with pre-resolved attributes ahead of time, which enables immediate and fast unpacking into variables. Additionally, standard `open()` avoids `pathlib.Path.open()`'s minor object-method overhead in paths executed repeatedly.
