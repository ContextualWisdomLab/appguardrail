## 2024-05-19 - Init Command UX Improvement
**Learning:** CLI outputs with inline repetitive warnings (e.g. `already contains rules — skipping`) can clutter terminal visibility and diminish developer experience.
**Action:** Group skipped/unchanged files separately from modified ones (e.g., in a single `Skipped (already configured):` section) to create clean, scannable terminal output.

## 2024-07-12 - Native Dialog Backdrop Pattern
**Learning:** The native `<dialog>` element provides a built-in way to detect backdrop clicks without extra backdrop wrappers or complex z-index management. Clicking the backdrop fires a click event where `e.target` is the dialog element itself, whereas clicking the modal content sets `e.target` to a child element.
**Action:** When using `<dialog>`, implement backdrop click-to-close with a simple `if (e.target === dialog) dialog.close()` listener to improve modal UX with zero dependencies.

## 2024-08-05 - Dynamic Rendering Cursor Position
**Learning:** When recreating input elements dynamically during client-side rendering (e.g. updating `innerHTML` after a search keystroke), re-focusing the element isn't enough. Simply placing the cursor at the end of the value disrupts users who are editing text in the middle of a string.
**Action:** Always capture `e.target.selectionStart` and `e.target.selectionEnd` before the DOM is replaced, and use `el.setSelectionRange(start, end)` after the element is re-rendered to maintain a seamless typing experience.

## 2024-10-27 - Root ARIA Live & Table Row ARIA Label Anti-patterns
**Learning:** Placing `aria-live="polite"` on root containers like `<main>` causes screen readers to read the whole app continuously upon any DOM update, rendering it unusable. Furthermore, adding `aria-label` to `<tr>` overrides natural table cell reading, hiding critical table data from screen reader users.
**Action:** Never place `aria-live` on root containers, restrict them to isolated notification nodes. Remove `aria-label` from table rows so natural cell-by-cell reading is preserved.
