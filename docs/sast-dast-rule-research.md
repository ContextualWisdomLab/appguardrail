# SAST/DAST Rule Research Notes

Date: 2026-06-30

Goal: add only direct, low-ambiguity code patterns from public SAST/DAST rule
families. Keep CVE/KEV/KNVD-style product advisories in Trivy/SCA scope unless
they imply a recurring code pattern.

User model: the default scanner must not ask beginners to choose a language
profile. AppGuardrail treats languages as independent axes discovered from the
files being scanned, then applies the union of relevant checks. Examples:

- Python + web: Python rules plus browser/HTTP/web-misconfiguration rules.
- Java only: generic built-in checks plus Semgrep/Trivy integration paths when
  available.
- Java + Node.js + TypeScript: Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript axes are merged;
  no special combo name or preset is required.

  validation.

  encoding marker.

- `java-hostname-verifier-allow-all`: CodeQL CWE-295-style allow-all
  HostnameVerifier marker.

  transport control.

  `claude-plugin-credential-store-access` for host ``~/.netrc``,
  ``~/.aws/credentials``, GitHub CLI hosts, Docker auth, cookie jars, and
  SSH private keys. Chrome/Firefox profile stores stay
  `claude-plugin-browser-profile-access`. Hardcoded PATs stay
  `claude-plugin-github-write-token`. ``gh issue create``, ``gh pr review``,
  ``kubectl get``, ``docker ps``, ``terraform plan``, ``helm list``,
  ``vercel ls``, and ``fly status`` stay inventory.
- Mapped, not owned here: GitHub Actions transport-only poll loops (#1087,
  PR #1088) and orphaned workflow registry DAST (#929, PR #966).
- `tool-execute-parameters-passthrough`: Strix-observed dynamic tool execution
  endpoint pattern where request `parameters` are dispatched directly into a
  registry/handler without a nearby schema boundary. This is language-agnostic
  because the risky shape is the `/tools/{code}/execute` dispatch surface, not
  one framework.

## Integration Paths

- Built-in AppGuardrail rules remain the beginner-safe default and are selected
  by file extension.
- `--external auto` is the CLI default for real CLI invocations. It detects
  runnable Bandit/Ruff for Python, Semgrep for Python/Java/JavaScript/
  TypeScript/web files, and ZAP only when `APPGUARDRAIL_TARGET_URL` or
  `--zap-baseline` supplies an authorized target URL.
- External CLIs that are missing or broken are skipped in auto mode. Explicit
  force flags (`--bandit`, `--ruff`, `--semgrep`, `--zap-baseline`) fail loudly
  because the user has asked for that engine.
- ZAP is not guessed from source code. DAST requires an authorized running URL,
  so AppGuardrail only runs it when a target URL is present.

## Not Promoted

- CVE, KEV, and KNVD/KVE product identifiers: handled by Trivy/SCA because a CVE
  ID usually needs package/version or product fingerprinting, not a code regex.
- Missing security headers by absence: too noisy for a file-local scanner. Only
  explicit disabled controls are promoted.
- Broad weak hash use: `md5`/`sha1` often appears in checksums, fixtures, and
  cache keys. Promote later only with a security-context marker.
- Generic SSRF URL fetch from request input: useful, but too context-dependent
  without framework routing and allowlist analysis.
- Generic SQL/XSS/command injection families already covered by existing
  AppGuardrail rules or Trivy/CodeQL integration paths. Tool execution dispatch
  is promoted only for the specific endpoint-plus-parameters pattern above.
