# SAST/DAST Rule Research Notes

Date: 2026-06-30

Goal: add only direct, low-ambiguity code patterns from public SAST/DAST rule
families. Keep CVE/KEV/KNVD-style product advisories in Trivy/SCA scope unless
they imply a recurring code pattern.

User model: the default scanner must not ask beginners to choose a language
profile. AppGuardrail treats languages as independent axes discovered from the
files being scanned, then applies the union of relevant checks. Examples:

- Python + web: Python rules plus browser/HTTP/web-misconfiguration rules.
- Java only: generic built-in checks plus Semgrep/Trivy integration paths when
  available.
- Java + Node.js + TypeScript: Java, JavaScript, and TypeScript axes are merged;
  no special combo name or preset is required.

## Promoted Rules

- `python-requests-verify-false`: Bandit B501/CWE-295-style disabled TLS cert
  validation.
- `python-tempfile-mktemp`: Python tempfile/CWE-377 predictable temp file creation.
- `python-flask-debug-true`: Bandit B201/CWE-489 active debug code.
- `python-jinja-autoescape-disabled`: Bandit B701/CWE-79 template XSS control off.
- `python-django-csrf-exempt`: CSRF protection bypass marker, CWE-352.
- `node-tls-validation-disabled`: CodeQL/Semgrep-style Node TLS validation off.
- `node-jwt-none-algorithm`: unsigned JWT algorithm allowance, CWE-347.
- `node-cors-wildcard-with-credentials`: ZAP/Semgrep CORS misconfiguration.
- `node-helmet-csp-disabled`: ZAP CSP class represented as explicit Helmet CSP off.
- `node-clickjacking-protection-disabled`: ZAP clickjacking class represented as
  explicit frame protection off.
- `express-reflected-input-send`: direct request-to-response sink without nearby
  encoding marker.
- `java-spring-csrf-disabled`: CodeQL CWE-352-style Spring CSRF disable marker.
- `java-hostname-verifier-allow-all`: CodeQL CWE-295-style allow-all
  HostnameVerifier marker.
- `java-cookie-secure-false`: explicit disabling of the HTTPS-only cookie
  transport control.
- `java-jwt-none-algorithm`: JWT none algorithm marker.
- `java-objectinputstream-deserialization`: direct Java native deserialization
  entry point, CWE-502.
- `tool-execute-parameters-passthrough`: Strix-observed dynamic tool execution
  endpoint pattern where request `parameters` are dispatched directly into a
  registry/handler without a nearby schema boundary. This is language-agnostic
  because the risky shape is the `/tools/{code}/execute` dispatch surface, not
  one framework.

## Integration Paths

- Built-in AppGuardrail rules remain the beginner-safe default and are selected
  by file extension.
- `--external auto` is the CLI default for real CLI invocations. It detects
  runnable Bandit/Ruff for Python, Semgrep for Python/Java/JavaScript/
  TypeScript/web files, and ZAP only when `APPGUARDRAIL_TARGET_URL` or
  `--zap-baseline` supplies an authorized target URL.
- External CLIs that are missing or broken are skipped in auto mode. Explicit
  force flags (`--bandit`, `--ruff`, `--semgrep`, `--zap-baseline`) fail loudly
  because the user has asked for that engine.
- ZAP is not guessed from source code. DAST requires an authorized running URL,
  so AppGuardrail only runs it when a target URL is present.

## Not Promoted

- CVE, KEV, and KNVD/KVE product identifiers: handled by Trivy/SCA because a CVE
  ID usually needs package/version or product fingerprinting, not a code regex.
- Missing security headers by absence: too noisy for a file-local scanner. Only
  explicit disabled controls are promoted.
- Broad weak hash use: `md5`/`sha1` often appears in checksums, fixtures, and
  cache keys. Promote later only with a security-context marker.
- Generic SSRF URL fetch from request input: useful, but too context-dependent
  without framework routing and allowlist analysis.
- Generic SQL/XSS/command injection families already covered by existing
  AppGuardrail rules or Trivy/CodeQL integration paths. Tool execution dispatch
  is promoted only for the specific endpoint-plus-parameters pattern above.
