# AppGuardrail Threat Model

**Status:** Accepted baseline  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-09

## Scope

Covers built-in scanning, optional external engines, findings/SARIF/reporting, deterministic fixes, GitHub monitor workflows, the current SQLite control plane, webhook egress, issue-to-detector assurance, and autonomous-development authority.

## Threat inventory

| Threat | Impact | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| detector fixture asserts its own answer | false issue-coverage confidence | independent inventory + answer-free evidence + actual detector execution |
| workflow metadata or caller assertion masquerades as detector truth | false SAST/DAST or issue-coverage assurance | pinned REST acquisition, generated source identity, SHA-256 bounded artifact, fixed probe/acquirer refs, typed fail-closed unknown |
| unsupported structural rule presented as built-in | false negative/marketing error | explicit built-in vs external-engine capability/maturity |
| scanner/tool unavailable treated as clean | false security assurance | explicit unavailable/inconclusive classification |
| secret extraction/reflection | credential disclosure | redacted/fingerprinted findings; bounded logs/reports |
| malicious target repository | command/file/resource abuse | bounded file discovery/tool invocation; no instruction-following from source |
| stored webhook SSRF | internal network access later | validate before persistence and execution, redirect/DNS/IP policy |
| direct ZAP/target SSRF | unauthorized attack/egress | explicit authorized target, safe URL policy, bounded runtime |
| cross-tenant API-key misuse | scan/history disclosure | authenticated role/organization authority; negative tests |
| API key leakage | tenant compromise | hashed/stored key handling, no console/log disclosure except intended bootstrap file |
| autofix changes semantics | application regression | only proven semantics-preserving deterministic transforms |
| external-engine provenance lost | misleading findings | retain engine/rule/version/source |
| deploy exclusions erase evidence | hidden risk | exclusions affect gate only; finding remains visible |
| tampered SBOM/report evidence | acquisition/security misstatement | deterministic source/lock provenance and manifest hashes |
| autonomous model self-approval | governance bypass | developer/reviewer/merge/release authority separation |

## Stored SSRF abuse case

A URL may be safe syntactically but unsafe after DNS resolution, redirect, or later execution. Stored-destination security therefore spans source trust, canonical URL/scheme/port policy, DNS/IP classification, redirect behavior, persistence, and execution-time revalidation/egress. A storage guard and a scanner rule are separate controls.

## Issue-coverage abuse case

A retained historical issue can tempt an audit to “cover” itself by mapping an issue to metadata that already states the expected outcome. That is circular assurance. The evidence producer must be independent enough that the detector adapter derives the result from bounded evidence, and workflow incidents require authenticated repository/run/job/head provenance.

The source-bound workflow adapter treats a failed security job as a failed
security control only. It never upgrades that result to a confirmed
vulnerability, and it does not persist raw logs. Missing identity, stale or
duplicate artifacts, malformed payloads, ambiguous cause order, unavailable
sources, and unknown detector families remain `unknown`.

## Residual risk

No static scanner proves application security. Dynamic/runtime/business-logic vulnerabilities may require external tools or human review. AppGuardrail must state toolset/evidence limits and avoid `Clean Scan` claims when a selected required engine could not run.

## Review triggers

Revisit when adding a structural matcher, new external engine, behavior-changing autofix, new network/egress path, persistent tenant schema, new issue-evidence source, or changed autonomous/release credential boundary.
