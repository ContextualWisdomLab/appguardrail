# AppGuardrail Logical and Persistence ERD

**Status:** Accepted cross-cutting data model; active-PR detector-obligation entities are labelled.  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-09

Current control-plane persistence is SQLite behind repository service functions. The scanner itself is primarily filesystem/in-memory and emits normalized finding envelopes. This ERD distinguishes current persistent scan history from active-PR/planned detection-obligation evidence. Exact physical SQLite table/column names remain source/migration authority; logical evidence fields below define the product contract even when the current store embeds them in a normalized JSON envelope.

Persistent object naming should converge on descriptive two-or-more-word `snake_case` when schema changes occur.

### Finding evidence provenance contract

`bounded_metadata_json` is supplementary metadata, not the provenance/authentication authority. A normalized finding that participates in trusted evidence records the following logical keys explicitly:

- `engine_code` and `engine_version` — exact detector/adapter identity and version;
- `source_kind_code` — built-in source scan, external engine import, workflow evidence, historical/imported evidence, or another closed source class;
- `producer_capability_code` and `producer_identity` — which component/identity was authorized to create the evidence class;
- `signed_payload_digest` — canonical digest over the immutable normalized evidence envelope, including rule, engine/version, source, producer, location/fingerprint, and bounded evidence metadata;
- `signature_status_code`, `signature_algorithm_code`, and `signature_value` — explicit authentication result and signature material where cryptographic authentication is required.

A local built-in detector may use a closed `not_applicable_local` signature status when provenance is established inside the same verified process boundary; imported/workflow evidence cannot be promoted to authenticated evidence unless its required producer capability, digest coverage, and signature/attestation validation succeed. Missing, malformed, unsupported, mismatched, or unverifiable signature evidence produces `evidence_untrusted`, never `completed_clean` or a registry PASS.

## Webhook delivery model

The current generic webhook implementation is **at-most-once per local scan event**: it performs one best-effort POST after destination validation and does not schedule automatic retries. There is therefore no receiver deduplication or synthetic delivery identifier that may be relied on for retry safety today. `delivery_semantics_code` documents this logical contract as `at_most_once_current`.

A future retrying webhook design must be a reviewed contract change that adds a stable `delivery_id`, persists delivery-attempt state, requires receiver-side deduplication on that identifier, revalidates the destination at every attempt/redirect, and caps retry/backoff. Until that exists, transport failure is retained as bounded evidence and is not retried automatically by the current webhook path.

Destination validation is also a connection-time control, including for the current one-shot sender. Every send attempt and redirect hop must resolve and evaluate the destination under the current network policy, reject every private, loopback, link-local, metadata, unspecified, multicast, or reserved address, and use connection-time address pinning (or an equivalently strong connector) so the socket cannot re-resolve to an unapproved address after validation. TLS still uses the original hostname for SNI and certificate verification, the redirect limit remains bounded, and the connected peer address must be one of the approved addresses before request bytes are sent. A stored validation result or earlier DNS answer is never reusable authorization.

```

This second model is an **active-PR logical contract**, not a protected-develop persisted schema. PR #911 may use committed JSON/registry/fixtures rather than these as database tables.

### Issue-claim identity and storage scope

Issue numbers are repository-local. A claim is uniquely scoped by the composite identity `(repository_full_name, issue_number, claim_identifier)`; no implementation may key a retained issue claim by issue number alone.

`repository_full_name` is the canonical GitHub `owner/repository` identity. `canonical_claim_key` is a stable versioned semantic key from the retained issue-claim registry, not a transient list position. `claim_identifier` is generated deterministically from the versioned namespace plus canonical repository identity, decimal issue number, and canonical claim key. Equivalent registry regeneration must produce the same identifier; a different repository with the same issue number/key must produce a different composite identity. A semantic claim replacement is represented as a new canonical claim key/identifier with explicit supersession rather than silently reusing the old identity.

The documentation/registry contract tests must cover stable regeneration and cross-repository issue-number collisions before PR #911 can promote this model.

### Workflow evidence authentication contract

`WORKFLOW_EVIDENCE` does not become trusted merely because a run is green. Its producer identity/capability, source class, exact workflow/run/head identity, engine/workflow version, canonical signed payload digest, signature/attestation status, algorithm, and signature value are explicit evidence fields. `attestation_type_code` identifies the required attestation contract, `attestation_issuer` is the authorized issuer or key identifier, and `attestation_reference` is an optional immutable transparency-log or provider reference. For `detached_signature`, `signature_value` is the attestation value and `signature_algorithm_code` selects its verifier; the issuer must be authorized for `producer_capability_code`. Workflow/imported evidence requires all applicable attestation fields and a valid signature. A local same-process detector may instead use the closed `not_applicable_local` type/status only when no external trust claim is made.

Verification must reject a digest mismatch, wrong repository/head/run identity, unauthorized producer capability or issuer, unsupported attestation/signature algorithm, invalid signature, missing required attestation, or mutable reference as `evidence_untrusted`.

### Canonical evidence serialization and digest linkage

Producer and verifier implementations use the same byte contract; a phrase such as “canonical digest” is not sufficient:

1. Schema validation runs first. Text values are converted to Unicode NFC. Object members are then serialized as RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) bytes in UTF-8, including JCS property ordering, escaping, and number formatting. Non-finite numbers are rejected. Omitted and explicit `null` are distinct: required fields cannot be omitted, optional absent fields are omitted, and `null` is serialized only where the versioned schema explicitly permits it.
2. `bounded_metadata_json` is parsed as bounded I-JSON, recursively normalized by the same rules, and embedded as a JSON value; its source whitespace or member order is never hashed as an opaque string. Duplicate member names, invalid Unicode, out-of-range numbers, and schema-unknown security fields fail closed.
3. Every digest is lowercase hexadecimal SHA-256 over the resulting canonical bytes with no prefix, delimiter, or platform newline. Contract fixtures publish both canonical UTF-8 bytes and the expected digest so independent producer and verifier implementations must match on member-order, omitted-versus-null, numeric, Unicode NFC, and nested-metadata edge cases.

Digest coverage is versioned and non-circular. `signed_payload_digest` covers the canonical `WORKFLOW_EVIDENCE` envelope fields `repository_full_name`, `workflow_name`, `job_name`, `head_sha`, `run_id`, `run_attempt`, `producer_identity`, `producer_capability_code`, `source_kind_code`, `engine_version`, `conclusion_code`, `evidence_digest`, `attestation_type_code`, and `attestation_issuer`; signed_payload_digest excludes itself plus `signature_status_code`, `signature_algorithm_code`, `signature_value`, and `attestation_reference`. `evidence_digest` covers the immutable `DETECTOR_EVIDENCE_CASE` identity, obligation, evidence type, provenance status, and ordered referenced-artifact digests. `finding_digest` covers the canonical `OBLIGATION_RESULT` identity/result/rule plus the normalized finding envelope and its `evidence_case_id` and `evidence_digest`. The workflow envelope links to a finding only when its `evidence_digest` exactly equals the referenced evidence case and the result's `finding_digest` verifies from that same case; mismatches remain `evidence_untrusted`.

## Identity and tenancy invariants

- API key identity resolves organization authority; repository/org strings inside scan payloads cannot elevate access.
- Finding IDs, scan IDs, issue numbers, rule IDs, and GitHub run IDs are evidence identities, not authorization identities.
- Repository identity is part of every retained issue-claim identity; issue number alone is never globally unique.
- Webhook destination strings are protected network destinations and must pass policy before persistence/execution.
- Raw secrets discovered in target code are not copied into durable findings; retain rule/location/fingerprint or bounded redacted evidence instead.

## Finding provenance

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SRC[Target source/config]
    ENG[Built-in or external engine]
    AUTH[Producer capability + evidence authentication]
    FIND[Normalized finding]
    SCAN[Scan envelope]
    SARIF[SARIF/report/control plane]

    SRC --> ENG
    ENG --> AUTH
    AUTH --> FIND
    FIND --> SCAN
    SCAN --> SARIF
```

A finding retains engine/rule/provenance across transformations. AppGuardrail must not erase the distinction between built-in and external-engine evidence or treat unauthenticated imported evidence as an authenticated detector result.

## Schema evolution rule

A future managed PostgreSQL control plane requires explicit migration/rollback, tenant authorization/RLS where used, idempotency/concurrency, webhook/egress security, backup/recovery, retention/deletion, provenance/signature validation, and cross-tenant tests. Conceptual issue-obligation entities become persistent only through such a reviewed migration, not merely by being drawn here.
