# Product / Technical Gap Baseline

**Status:** Active commercial-readiness baseline  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-03

This document records buyer-visible and control-plane gaps that are supported by current AppGuardrail code, tests, review evidence, and canonical-owner boundaries. It is not a substitute for live pull-request checks or protected-branch evidence.

## Product boundary

AppGuardrail owns reusable static-analysis and SARIF evidence. It may detect unsafe GitHub Actions control flow, but `.github` remains the canonical owner of organization-wide CI, review, runner, security, and release behavior. AppGuardrail must not copy or mutate that owner source to make a leaf detector pass.

The current GitHub Actions polling family covers a bounded conventional grammar: two-space Actions jobs, literal shell `run` blocks, executable `gh api` polling, transport-failure budgets, total deadline/attempt guards, selected state-reset patterns, and reviewed unreachable fail-closed exits. It does not claim general shell control-flow or data-flow analysis.

## Current implemented evidence

Issue #1087 is backed by the protected `.github` vulnerable predecessor `5c561a65cca3b925d533e4b40c5c3ac00f16524e` and protected wall-clock repair `e29302c05eade7da7b0bdbb453e53980bc9d577b`.

PR #1088 carries four HIGH/CWE-400 detector identities:

- `github-actions-transport-only-poll-bound` for the historical transport-budget incident shape;
- `github-actions-transport-failure-budget-poll-bound` for renamed failure-counter/limit shapes;
- `github-actions-poll-bound-state-reset` for reviewed non-convergent mutation of apparent total bounds;
- `github-actions-poll-bound-unreachable-exit` for reviewed guards whose fail-closed exit is unreachable.

The historical detector now requires causal transport-budget evidence rather than a matching setting name alone. Test-first commit `df4ff1c3f724764b1d047b2cb95ef491c096356c` pins both the negative unused-setting case and the positive counter-flow case. Production commit `a467678c7e3b4bedca8092eec28072fdd0aae90a` requires a zeroed counter, failing executable `gh api` path, counter increment, comparison with `max_poll_transport_failures`, and nonzero threshold exit in the same reviewed polling flow. Commit `5d87c36251391e5f0254eb915ca7f3068a22b21c` repairs older scope/timeout fixtures so positive historical tests use that same causal incident contract instead of relying on the configuration name alone.

Current review exposed two additional precision contracts, both pinned first as production `_scan_file` regressions in `d50f49ccea1cbf2aecc6da268850fddfc80db3b6`: a strict `-gt` total deadline/attempt guard is still finite, and a statically positive owning-job `timeout-minutes: ${{ 20 }}` expression is still a hard bound. Zero, negative, and dynamic timeout expressions remain unproved and must not suppress a finding. These contracts are RED until production matching semantics are repaired and the unchanged head obtains exact-head test evidence.

## Commercial and technical gaps

| Gap | Current evidence | Acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| Strict finite-bound comparator precision | Current polling safety exclusions recognize `-ge` but review identified false HIGH findings for equivalent finite `-gt` deadline/attempt guards. RED regressions in `d50f49ccea1cbf2aecc6da268850fddfc80db3b6` cover historical and identifier-agnostic transport forms plus both total-attempt declaration orders. | Recognize forward `-gt` as well as `-ge` for the same causally initialized wall-clock and total-attempt state, without accepting reversed or non-expiring comparisons. Keep all existing positive vulnerable regressions. |
| Static positive timeout-expression precision | Current job-local timeout exclusions recognize positive integer literals but not the statically positive Actions expression `${{ 20 }}`. RED regressions in `d50f49ccea1cbf2aecc6da268850fddfc80db3b6` cover both primary transport detectors, state-reset, and unreachable-exit companions; zero, negative, and dynamic expressions remain positive-vulnerability controls. | All four polling detectors suppress only for an owning-job timeout that is provably positive at scan time, including a positive integer constant expression. Do not suppress zero, negative, empty, dynamic/unprovable expressions or sibling-job timeouts. |
| General GitHub Actions + shell control-flow analysis | The detector family deliberately uses bounded regex grammar and adjacency windows. Composite actions, generated workflows, non-shell control flow, cross-file state, noncanonical YAML structures, and materially different loop frameworks are explicit false-negative boundaries. | Introduce a structural Actions/shell analysis layer only with executable regression migration oracles, bounded performance evidence, and no regression in current detector identities. Do not claim universal shell semantics from more regex. |
| Exact-head security execution | PR #1088 has repeatedly produced CodeQL `startup_failure` runs with no materialized source job. Test-contract head `d50f49ccea1cbf2aecc6da268850fddfc80db3b6` reproduced this as CodeQL run `33682495071` with `jobs=[]`. | Canonical `.github` owner restores real job materialization/runner admission and the unchanged candidate obtains terminal source-analysis evidence. Startup failure, zero-job runs, predecessor success, or leaf no-op retriggers are not GREEN. |
| Protected integration | Production/test changes invalidate predecessor checks. AppGuardrail review threads remain evidence obligations until current-head tests and required controls are terminal GREEN. | Ordinary protected merge only after all live findings are reconciled, exact-head tests/security/SAST/code-scanning requirements pass, qualifying independent review is satisfied, and base ancestry remains valid. |
| Immutable release evidence | An active PR is not a released detector contract. | After protected integration, publish version/CHANGELOG/tag/package plus SBOM, provenance, reproducibility and rollback evidence through the repository's canonical release path before consumers treat this detector family as immutable release evidence. |

## Architecture decision

For #1087, retain the existing lightweight detector family as a bounded product capability and use its production `_scan_file` regressions as migration oracles. Do not expand regex until it can prove the next concrete buyer/security case without blocker-class false positives. If shell ownership, nested conditional pairing, composite-action flow, or cross-file state becomes material, move that responsibility into a structural Actions/shell analyzer with explicit AST/control-flow/data-flow semantics rather than accumulating regex that implies unsupported completeness.

The choice preserves the current low-cost scanner, keeps `.github` prevention authority separate from AppGuardrail detection authority, and makes the remaining coverage boundary visible to buyers and maintainers instead of hiding it behind broad security claims.

## Release gate

This baseline does not mark PR #1088 merge-ready or release-ready. Every source or documentation commit requires fresh exact-head verification. A current PR head, required checks, reviews, branch protection state, release state, and canonical-owner runner evidence must be read live before promotion.
