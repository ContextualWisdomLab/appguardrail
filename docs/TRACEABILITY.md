# AppGuardrail Requirements, Detection, and Evidence Traceability

**Status:** Accepted cross-cutting baseline  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-08-14

| Requirement / security class | Detector/control boundary | Evidence maturity |
|---|---|---|
| built-in deterministic scanning | `scanner.py`, rule adapters, normalized findings | implemented-main |
| optional Trivy/Bandit/Ruff/Semgrep/ZAP | external-engine adapters | implemented-main when tool present; capability explicit |
| JSON/SARIF findings | reporting serializers | implemented-main |
| deploy gate/exclusions | gate policy | implemented-main |
| safe deterministic autofix | fix engine | implemented-main for supported transforms only |
| multi-tenant scan/history/drift/API keys | control plane | implemented-main |
| webhook config/notification | control plane/network boundary | implemented-main; storage-boundary SSRF hardening integrated through PR #924 |
| buyer/founder/agency/fix-pack reports | report modules | implemented-main |
| CycloneDX SBOM | SBOM module | implemented-main |
| organization buyer evidence | org evidence aggregator | implemented-main |
| RCA-first feasibility scheduler | CI/agent policy | implemented-main |
| every retained issue claim mapped to executable detector obligation | issue-detection audit | PR #911 active-PR |
| authenticated workflow-result detector evidence | issue-detection audit workflow evidence | PR #911 active-PR |
| automatic scanner detection of unsafe stored-webhook SSRF pattern | built-in `python-stored-ssrf-webhook-url` rule | implemented-main through PR #910 for tested Python `set_webhook` direct and one-hop persistence flows; bounded scope |
| automatic scanner detection of hardcoded JWT HMAC secret fallback | built-in `javascript-jwt-hardcoded-secret-fallback` rule | PR #941 active-PR for the tested Node.js HS256 `process.env` literal-fallback source shape collected in issues #462, #463, #468, and #469; promote only after protected-head merge evidence |
| structural Semgrep-style `pattern:` execution by lightweight engine | built-in scanner | not implemented unless a real structural matcher is added; fixtures are not execution |

## Promotion rules

- `implemented-main` requires source/tests on protected `develop`, not an issue/PR description.
- `active-PR` becomes current only after merge plus fresh protected-head required evidence.
- External-engine capability must name the engine and availability; normalization does not convert it into a built-in detector.
- A prevention/hardening change does not automatically promote the matching scanner-detection row; PR #924 and PR #910 were verified and promoted independently.
- An issue registry mapping cannot promote an obligation unless actual detector execution derives its result from independent/closed evidence.

## Issue #911 traceability contract

When PR #911 is accepted, the authoritative obligation system should preserve issue number/claim identity, detector family, evidence fixture/workflow provenance, execution result, and detector rule/finding evidence. Deduplicating equivalent incidents into one detector family is allowed; dropping a retained claim through an exclusion/waiver list is not.

## SSRF traceability contract

For stored webhook/callback SSRF, trace separately:

1. application prevention at configuration storage;
2. execution-time URL/DNS/IP/redirect/egress validation;
3. AppGuardrail scanner rule capable of finding missing prevention in target code;
4. positive vulnerable fixture;
5. fixed negative fixture;
6. control-plane self-regression;
7. exact-head security/review evidence.

Current protected-branch evidence keeps those controls distinct: PR #924 supplies the fail-closed webhook storage boundary, and PR #910 supplies the packaged `python-stored-ssrf-webhook-url` detector plus focused regression corpus. Neither control expands the detector beyond its declared source/sink and flow contract.

## JWT signing-secret traceability contract

For hardcoded symmetric JWT signing-key fallbacks, trace separately:

1. every collected issue/event identity and exact source head;
2. the vulnerable source blob containing the environment lookup plus literal fallback;
3. the reviewed fail-closed source blob with no source-controlled fallback;
4. the packaged detector rule and bounded prefilter;
5. the same-variable HMAC signing sink requirement;
6. production `_scan_file` execution with secret-snippet redaction;
7. false-positive negatives for random runtime fallback and non-signing configuration;
8. exact-head security, review, and merge evidence.

PR #941 carries this detector family for ScopeWeave PR #387 events collected in issues #462, #463, #468, and #469. The detector is deliberately bounded to the tested JavaScript/TypeScript `process.env` plus `createHmac("sha256", key)` HS256 shape. It does not claim general cross-file JWT-library or weak-key detection.

## Standards/research

Existing repository docs/doctoring/security evidence remain the bibliography/source-of-truth for standards such as SARIF, CycloneDX, GitHub security interfaces, and applicable OWASP/CWE classes. Material new detector classes should add authoritative standard/CWE/OWASP references and APA 7 citations in doctoring where research/standards materially drive implementation. The JWT fallback detector references and remediation boundary are recorded in `docs/detectors/jwt-secret-fallback.md`.

## Change rule

Every new issue-class detector or product security boundary should add/update a row and its concrete test/evidence path. Stale/queued/cancelled/rate-limited/predecessor checks cannot promote evidence maturity.
