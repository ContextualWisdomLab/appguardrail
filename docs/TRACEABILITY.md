## Promotion rules

- `implemented-main` requires source/tests on protected `develop`, not an issue/PR description.
- `active-PR` becomes current only after merge plus fresh protected-head required evidence.
- External-engine capability must name the engine and availability; normalization does not convert it into a built-in detector.
- A prevention/hardening change does not automatically promote the matching scanner-detection row; PR #924 and PR #910 were verified and promoted independently.
- An issue registry mapping cannot promote an obligation unless actual detector execution derives its result from independent/closed evidence.

## Issue #911 traceability contract

When PR #911 is accepted, the authoritative obligation system should preserve issue number/claim identity, detector family, evidence fixture/workflow provenance, execution result, and detector rule/finding evidence. Deduplicating equivalent incidents into one detector family is allowed; dropping a retained claim through an exclusion/waiver list is not.

## SSRF traceability contract

For stored webhook/callback SSRF, trace separately:

1. application prevention at configuration storage;
2. execution-time URL/DNS/IP/redirect/egress validation;
3. AppGuardrail scanner rule capable of finding missing prevention in target code;
4. positive vulnerable fixture;
5. fixed negative fixture;
6. control-plane self-regression;
7. exact-head security/review evidence.

Current protected-branch evidence keeps those controls distinct: PR #924 supplies the fail-closed webhook storage boundary, and PR #910 supplies the packaged `python-stored-ssrf-webhook-url` detector plus focused regression corpus. Neither control expands the detector beyond its declared source/sink and flow contract.

## Standards/research

Existing repository docs/doctoring/security evidence remain the bibliography/source-of-truth for standards such as SARIF, CycloneDX, GitHub security interfaces, and applicable OWASP/CWE classes. Material new detector classes should add authoritative standard/CWE/OWASP references and APA 7 citations in doctoring where research/standards materially drive implementation.

## Change rule

Every new issue-class detector or product security boundary should add/update a row and its concrete test/evidence path. Stale/queued/cancelled/rate-limited/predecessor checks cannot promote evidence maturity.
