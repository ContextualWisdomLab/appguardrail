### Security

- Replace regex-only Python shell-call matching with an AST-backed detector that
  resolves `os` and `subprocess` aliases, handles arbitrary parsed argument
  nesting, ignores comments and strings, respects lexical shadowing, and keeps
  malformed work-in-progress files non-crashing. `subprocess` findings remain
  limited to literal `shell=True`; existing rule identity and remediation copy
  are preserved.
