"""Static analysis for Claude plugin marketplace entries and package trees.

Findings come from parsed manifests and executable surfaces, not from issue
titles. A floating Git ref, provider secret, pipe-to-shell installer,
unsigned executable download, package.json lifecycle download, unpinned
package URL install, dynamic eval/exec, undeclared hook, hidden undeclared
executable or config surface, archive path
escape, decompression bomb or nested-archive depth, unadmitted nested
submodule, hardcoded GitHub write token, GitHub merge or release CLI command, Docker
socket bind, host browser-profile store, host cookie or token store,
secret copied into a network request, secret copied into a prompt, log,
or subprocess environment, secret copied into MCP env or args,
a non-standard JSON constant, malformed UTF-8 JSON bytes, a
non-NFC identity name, conflicting plugin/skill/command identity,
undeclared vendored or generated third-party
code, a
description that denies inventoried write, network, GitHub
write, credential, remote MCP, or shell capabilities, or a released
skill-supply-chain finding on a plugin skill/agent surface is a policy
finding. Capability inventory is evidence,
not permission, except that hook or manifest ``gh pr merge`` and
``gh release create|upload|delete|edit`` fail closed as command findings.
Hook or manifest ``kubectl apply`` and ``docker push`` fail closed as
deployment-write command findings. Hook or manifest ``terraform apply``
and ``helm install`` fail closed as infra-write command findings.
Hook or manifest ``vercel deploy`` and ``fly deploy`` fail closed as
hosted-deploy command findings. Unquoted ``#`` comments and
``echo``/``printf``/``print`` lookalikes are not that class.
``terraform plan``, ``helm list``, ``vercel ls``, and ``fly status``
stay inventory. Hook or manifest paths into
``~/.netrc``, ``~/.aws/credentials``,
GitHub CLI hosts, Docker auth ``config.json``, cookie jars, and
``~/.ssh/id_*`` private keys fail closed as credential-store findings.
Chrome and Firefox profile stores stay browser-profile findings.
Hardcoded PATs stay write-token findings.
``gh issue create``, ``gh pr review``, ``kubectl get``, ``docker ps``,
``terraform plan``, ``helm list``, ``vercel ls``, and ``fly status``
stay inventory. Skill
homoglyph, injection, exfiltration, and placeholder hits reuse #1036 rule
identities. Skill, command, or agent text that hides tool use, rewrites
the system prompt, or escalates the declared goal is a separate
instruction-override family. Setuid, setgid, or world-writable executable
and hook files fail admission. Zip or tar members whose uncompressed size
divided by compressed size exceeds the bounded ratio, or nested archives
beyond a small depth, fail admission without extracting the payload.
A lockfile-backed package.json without a
lifecycle download stays inventory. Vendored trees are one scope finding,
not hook scans. A first-party ``SHA256SUMS``, ``SHA256SUMS.txt``,
``checksums.sha256``, or ``*.sha256`` next to ``plugin.json`` that names
the plugin artifact or enumerated files fails closed when the digest
disagrees with bytes on disk. Comments are ignored. Absence of a
checksum or Cosign signature is not that class. Receipts bind
``policy_provenance`` to the running AppGuardrail release and the exact
scan-policy bytes, and ``sbom_sha256`` to a deterministic CycloneDX
document of declared dependencies; verification fails closed when that
digest or scanner version disagrees. ``scan_result=pass`` is not Noema
admission.
